This decision may seem arbitrary, misguided, or ill-timed. In once sense, this might be the case:\n- You're electing classmates who you've known for less than a few weeks.\n- No one really understands the positions these classmates will be elected to.\n- The election happens within the first week when you're just trying to stay afloat with a million things happening at once.\nDon't worry, it's one of the things that needs to happen early, and every class goes through it. Understanding what exactly these officers do and what skills makes someone fit for it will help you choose officers that will serve you well. \n## The Positions\n4 officers will be chosen early on in your semester. \n- President\n- Vice President\n- Treasurer\n- Secretary\nYou'll no doubt get a small talk and some handouts explaining what each position does and why they're important. However, I'd like to provide a couple of other considerations that might be important to know before an election, as well as some tips on interacting with the class executive board throughout your time in school.\n### The President\nThe President is the head of the board and it responsible for acting as the primary representative of your class. This means:\n- When professors need to communicate something to your class, they will do it through the class president. If a class wide email goes out and a consensus response is needed, your class president will deliver it.\n- Class wide decisions will be delivered though your president, mostly through scheduling. \n- They attend the governing OOSA (Oklahoma Optometry Student Association) and AOSA (American Optometry Student Association) board meetings and will give a report on behalf of your class.\n- And perhaps most importantly, they will be responsible for handling your class's testing and finals schedule. \nAs you progress in school, you'll quickly find out that the examination and quizzing cycle is very rigorous. There will be many of them. **That being said, teachers are generally fairly flexible on when they will administer tests and quizzes.** This means that the class has some say not necessarily *if* they'll take these tests but *when*. The president will typically be responsible for taking a poll or deciding which quizzes and tests get scheduled when. \nChoosing a good president can be hard if you don't know your fellow classmates very well yet. But in general, you'll want to look for a person who:\n- Is great at receiving and responding to communication\n- Is proactive rather than sitting back and letting these come to them\n- Is decisive in moments that don't require a vote\n- Values opinions and consensus\n- Sleeps okay at night with criticism and unkind words at times\nThe president will be doing a lot of the legwork for the class's quality of life. Read more about the experiences of Class of 2028's president Cam McClure. \n### Vice President\nThe Vice President is often overlooked but holds a crucial position within the board. They often act as the president's chief advisor and is another perspective to which classmates can communicate concerns and issues with. The vice president steps in when the president is not available. This means that generally, you'll want a vice president who has many of the common qualities of a president mentioned earlier. A few unique things you'd want in a vice president:\n- Is highly persuasive and convincing when representing the viewpoints of classmates\n- Is supportive and is okay with being in the background when needed\n- Takes charge to help the president when the plate start filling up\n- Builds relationships to understand class sentiment\nOf course, you'd want these traits in any person in leadership, but I've often noticed good class vice presidents possessing these. Perhaps something to think about.\n### Treasurer\nLuckily, the position of class treasurer doesn't really need much explanation. So I'll cut to the chase -- here's what you'll want in one:\n- Is responsible with money\n- Is on top of deadlines, dues, and budgets\n- Is efficient with collection and dispersion of funds\n- Works will with taking direction from the president and vice president\n- Takes initiative when it comes to money related responsibilities. \nOur class treasurer traditionally also helps to celebrate birthdays. This is probably one of the greatest morale boosters during dreadful weeks: a happy song and a small gift presented by the treasurer on your special day of birth. Whether it be collection for gifts or a project or something else, you'll rely on a competent treasurer on the regular. \n### Secretary\nIn my humble opinion, this position provides the most useful tangible benefits for the class. They are responsible for keeping records, itineraries, reminders, and schedules. **The class schedule is one of the most referenced resource for your cohort.** It's critical that the publishing of that schedule is nice, neat, timely, and accurate.\n> I would not be able to live without the class schedule and am very thankful for it.\n\\- Cooper McCoy, also Cooper McCoy's wife\nWith this in mind, you'll want someone who\n- Is highly detailed oriented and prompt\n- Cares about how things look and will be perceived\n- Is not afraid to reach out when they don't know something\n- Is handy with a spreadsheet or schedule software\n</context_primary>\n</context>"},{"type":"text","text":"Can you check for any typos or unclear sentences?"}]}]},"responses":[{"timestamp":1750440997329,"id":"2025-06-20T17:36:16.554842Z","object":"chat.completion","created":1750440997329,"model":"gemma3:latest","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay, here's a review of the document, focusing on typos, unclear sentences, and suggestions for improvement. I’ve grouped the feedback for clarity.\n\n**I. General Comments & Tone:**\n\n*   **Voice:** The document has a very conversational, almost informal, tone. While this is fine for a guide, it occasionally feels a bit too casual for a document intended to provide helpful information. Consider adjusting the language to be slightly more professional, especially when outlining responsibilities.\n*   **Repetition:** There's some repetition of ideas (e.g., wanting someone proactive, detail-oriented). Try to consolidate similar points.\n\n**II. Specific Edits & Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Introduction:**\n    *   “One of the strangest things I think that the school makes first years do is…” – This is a slightly awkward phrasing.  Try: “One of the first things the school does is elect class officers within the first week of classes.”\n*   **General Sections:**\n    *   “That being said, teachers are generally fairly flexible…” – “fairly flexible” is a bit vague.  Consider: “Teachers are generally willing to…” or “Teachers often offer flexibility…”\n    *   “Sleeps okay at night with criticism and unkind words at times” – This is a strange and potentially off-putting phrase.  Rephrase: “Is resilient and able to handle constructive criticism.”\n*   **President Section:**\n    *   “When professors need to communicate something to your class, they will do it through the class president.” – Slightly redundant.  Try: “Professors typically communicate with the class through the class president.”\n    *   “They attend the governing OOSA (Oklahoma Optometry Student Association) and AOSA (American Optometry Student Association) board meetings and will give a report on behalf of your class.” – Could be clearer: “They represent the class at OOSA and AOSA board meetings, providing a report on class activities.”\n    *   “Is resilient and able to handle constructive criticism.” - This is a good catch.\n*   **Vice President Section:**\n    *   “The plate start filling up” – Typo. Should be “plates.”\n    *   “Builds relationships to understand class sentiment” – Good point, but could be phrased more directly: “Develops strong relationships within the class to gauge opinions and concerns.”\n*   **Treasurer Section:**\n    *   “Works will with taking direction from the president and vice president” – Typo. Should be “works.”\n*   **Secretary Section:**\n    *   “I would not be able to live without the class schedule and am very thankful for it.” – This is a quote, and it’s fine, but consider adding a brief explanation of *why* it’s so important.  Example: “The class schedule is a critical resource, providing a centralized record of all class events and deadlines.”\n    *   “The class schedule is a critical resource, providing a centralized record of all class events and deadlines.” - This is a good catch.\n    *   “Is handy with a spreadsheet or schedule software” – Could be more specific: “Is proficient in using spreadsheet software or scheduling tools.”\n\n**III. Minor Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Formatting:** Consider using bullet points or numbered lists within each section to break up the text and improve readability.\n*   **Consistency:** Ensure consistent use of terminology (e.g., always use “class president” instead of sometimes “president”).\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n\n*   Create a revised version of the document incorporating these suggestions?\n*   Focus on a specific section for a more detailed review?"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0}}],"chat_model":{"model_key":"gemma3:latest","platform_key":"ollama"}},"key":"Untitled Chat 1750440919080-1750440929732","thread_key":"Untitled Chat 1750440919080","stream":true,"class_name":"SmartCompletion","context_key":"1750440926040","user_message":"Can you check for any typos or unclear sentences?","new_user_message":true},

Their job is all about details and announcements. Every Sunday during school my class gets an email from our secretary with all the events, tests, and other important information. It's the primer we need to get us ready for our week.\n## Conclusion\nThe executive board dynamic and responsibilities will contribute towards making your optometry school experience. But regardless of how much it matters who your class officers are, being a good classmate and participant in the system matter just as much. Keep this things in mind:\n- Be patient and understanding. The officers are fellow classmates and students, just like you.\n- Sometimes the officers are just the messengers. If a vote doesn't got your way or a decision comes down you don't quite agree with, it's a good opportunity to have a real informed and civil discussion about how you feel.\n- Class officers can be up for reelection from time to time. Choosing one person doesn't mean you have to stay with them for the rest of your years here. But it also doesn't mean you need to change them.\n- When finals come around, the officers take charge and help you build your finals schedule that is submitted to the faculty. Be sure to make your voice heard, but also be understanding of other voices in the room as well!\nLike many of the other small details and information that will get thrown at you first semester, you'll find the rhythm and inner workings soon. Hopefully this has given you a bit more of a perspective when it comes to electing and interacting with class officers -- and a bit of gratitude for what they do.\n</context_primary>\n</context>"},{"type":"text","text":"Any glaring grammar and typo issues?
