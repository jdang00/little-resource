## Introduction
As future eye docs, understanding the little details on that little eye chart across the room is going to be essential. Here's a quick guide to get you up to speed on what you need to know about visual acuity, and some practical tips to answer questions about it on an exam.

## What is Visual Acuity (VA)?
Simply put, it's how well you can see something. It's a broad definition, but it helps us get to the core of what we're actually trying to find out -- can your patient see well? Knowing a person's VA's is going to help you: 

- Determine your patient's glasses prescription
- Their legal status to drive a motor vehicle
- Monitor and treat diseases that affect eyesight

So it's important we have an objective and universally understood way to measure and classify VAs. This will require a bit of math (ew) but the good news is that it's been greatly simplified by your predecessors to form the standards we use today.

The number next to the letters currently say 15. You bump the letters up a few sizes until it says 30. "NOPE" she declares. In an attempt to not offend her by putting up the 200 line, you bump it up to 50 and she reads it off correctly with the exception of one letter. What do you record?

## The Snellen Chart
Dutch ophthalmologist Snellen in the 1800s came up with the Snellen chart, a vertical stack of letters that get progressively smaller towards the bottom. Each line is assigned a fractional value to indicate the letter's associated measurement. This is how we'll actually determine someone's VAs. If they're able to make out the letter on the line, then they get the measurement associated with that line. Now if at this point you're saying "Yeah Justin, I obviously understand this. Been doing this as a technician for so many years. I've probably done VAs more times than Razorback sports lets down their fan base!" (This is a very sore subject, feel free to discuss this with Dr. Miller if you dare). What I'll say is this: awesome! This gives us a great segue to discuss what the numbers on the chart actually *mean*.

So you'll get a fractional value like:

$$\frac{20}{40}$$

- The top number is the testing distance. By standard convention, it's $20\;ft$ or $6\;m$.
- The bottom number is the distance the letter details must be in order to for 1 $min\;arc$ on the eye.


If at this point you're saying "what the crap is going on", I don't blame you. Let's break this down a bit further so we get a fundamental understanding of what we're trying to do.

## The Problem With Making Standard Measurements
Here's a question when coming up with a universal way to represent visual acuity: how do we standardize everything? Do we always assume the same distances? What if we need to do VAs at different distances? What about the size of the letters? Bigger ones are obviously easier to see, but how can we know for sure what size at what distances letters represent?

As it turns out, the Snellen measurement is determined by a relationship between the **distance at which the letter is tested at** and the **size of the letter**. Here's how it's done:

- As light enters the eye from a point source, the height of the object (a letter in this case) subtends on the retina. This is basically saying: There's an image that forms on the back of your eye from what you're looking at.
- For Snellen letters we measure how much they subtend on the retina in *minutes of arc*.
- Minutes of arc is determined by how far away the testing distance is and how much the object subtends the retina -- if you have a big letter at a short distance, the angle increases, therefore increase the minutes of arc. If you take that same big letter and move it father away, the angle decreases even though the height of the letter doesn't physically change. Its image on our retina does.

***By measuring the angle, which takes into account both distance and height of the letter, we now have a robust and accurate way to standardize acuity with only a few parameters.***

> Why does the angle the image subtends the retina decrease as you move it further away or as you decrease the height of the image?
> 
> ***The image becomes smaller, subtending a smaller area on your retina. This works by either moving the letters further away or decreasing its height. In theory, you could have a small letter up close or a big letter far away subtend the same angle on the retina.***

## Minutes of Arc?
A minute of arc is simply a 60th of a degree.

$$1\;\degree = 60\;minutes\;of\;arc$$
or,

$$\frac{1}{60} \degree = 1\;minutes\;of\;arc$$

Just like you measure angles in degrees, you can also measure them in arc units. This is because when we deal with the physics of light entered the eye, the angles usually get so small we need this unit in order to help us more accurately describe the model.

Unfortunately, he's on a diet to avoid the dreaded dad bod that inevitably claims all men when they become fathers. Thinking of his little son Bennett, he reluctantly take a tiny sliver of pie: $2\degree$ of pie to be exact. In arc minutes, how much pie did Austin take?

>  $120\;min\;arc$. ***At this point it'll take him 10,800 slices to finish the whole pie...***

So as you can see, it's simply just a smaller unit we can measure angles at. You'll also see arc seconds, which, like the time, corresponds accordingly:

$$60\;sec\;arc = 1\;minutes\;of\;arc$$
or,

$$\frac{1}{60}\;min\;of\;arc = 1\;seconds\;of\;arc$$

For really fine details, you'll use seconds, but the Snellen standard fractions assume a measurement in minutes of arc. 

## Anatomy of an Optotype
Optotypes are simply letters of figures of different sizes used to test the acuity of vision. They can be pictures of letters. Since we're most familiar with the Snellen letters, let's break down the parts of each letter so we have a basis to understanding how this correlates with the Snellen measurements we discussed earlier. 

Consider the 20/200 E letter. There are two types of details in any letter:
- Stroke width
- Gap width
![[Visual Acuity.001.png]]
As the names imply, a stroke is the thickness of a line or a drawn element, in black. A gap width is the empty space between strokes, elements, or enclosed shapes. These details distinguish what the letter actually is. The details of an $E$ look different than the details of a $D$. Here is the key fact to remember:

- **Each Snellen letter has 5 letter details.**

This could be a combination of 3 stroke details and 2 gap details. Or maybe 2 stroke details and 3 gap details. Point is, each letter, designed on a 5x5 grid and be reduced down to 5 letter details. This will come in very handy when we start talking about the angle of resolution and Snellen acuity.

>  And similarly:

>   $$3\;min\;arc\;per\;detail \times 5\;details = 15\;min\;arc$$

## Angle of Resolution
Now that we have a basic understanding of angles formed by the distances of the chart and the anatomy of the letters, we can move on to really understanding the objective measurement model of visual acuity. The first concept to understand is angle of resolution:

- The **angle of resolution** is the angle that lines and spaces formed by lines and spaces that allows us to see them as separate. 

To put it simply, visual acuity comes down to whether or not we can distinguish the details on a letter or not. Intuitively, this should make sense: if the details start blending together you won't be able to make the connection in your head that you're looking at a $Z$ or an $F$. 

To determine what visual acuity someone has, it's based off of the **minimum angle of resolution (MAR)** - the smallest angle that we can see as separate lines and spaces. For most people, their minimum angle of resolution is $1\;min\;arc$ or $\frac{1}{60^{th}}$ of a degree.
