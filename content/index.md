Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I built this hub to give you everything I wish I had when I was starting out. Inside youâ€™ll find past assignments, study tips, resources, and checklists â€” but more than that, I hope you find encouragement and confidence here. Youâ€™re not alone on this journey. Youâ€™ve got everything it takes â€” and now, youâ€™ve got a little extra support too. Take it at your own pace, explore, and know that Iâ€™m always just a message away if you need anything.
