## Introduction
Within the first week of school, your class will be electing 4 officers. This decision may seem a bit arbitrary, rushed, and ill-timed. In one sense, it's true:

- You're electing classmates who you've known for less than a few weeks.
- No one really understands the positions these classmates will be elected to.
- The election happens within the first week when you're just trying to stay afloat with a million things happening at once.

Don't worry, it's one of the things that needs to happen early, and every class goes through it. Understanding what exactly these officers do and what skills makes someone fit for it will help you choose officers that will serve you well. 

## The Positions
4 officers will be chosen early on in your semester. 

- President
- Vice President
- Treasurer
- Secretary

You'll no doubt get a small talk and some handouts explaining what each position does and why they're important. However, I'd like to provide a couple of other considerations that might be important to know before an election, as well as some tips on interacting with the class executive board throughout your time in school.

### The President
The President is the head of the board and it responsible for acting as the primary representative of your class. This means:

- Professors typically communicate with the class through the president. If a class wide email goes out and a consensus response is needed, your president will deliver it.
- Class wide decisions will be delivered though your president, mostly through scheduling. 
- They attend the governing OOSA (Oklahoma Optometry Student Association) and AOSA (American Optometry Student Association) board meetings and will give a report on behalf of your class.
- And perhaps most importantly, they will be responsible for handling your class's testing and finals schedule. 

As you progress in school, you'll quickly find out that the examination and quizzing cycle is very rigorous. There will be many of them. **That being said, teachers are generally quite flexible on when they will administer tests and quizzes.** This means that the class has some say not necessarily *if* they'll take these tests but *when*. The president will usually be responsible for taking a poll or deciding which quizzes and tests get scheduled when. 

Choosing a good president can be hard if you don't know your fellow classmates very well yet. But in general, you'll want to look for a person who:

- Is great at receiving and responding to communication
- Is proactive rather than sitting back and letting these come to them
- Is decisive in moments that don't require a vote
- Values opinions and consensus
- Sleeps okay at night when dealing with the occasional criticism and unkind word

The president will be doing a lot of the legwork for the class's quality of life. They get a lot of emails and messages! Read more about the experiences of Class of 2028's president Cam McClure. 

### Vice President
The Vice President is often overlooked but holds a crucial position within the board. They often act as the president's chief advisor and is another perspective to which classmates can communicate concerns and issues with. The vice president steps in when the president is not available. This means that generally, you'll want a vice president who has many of the common qualities of a president mentioned earlier. A few unique things you'd want in a vice president:

- Is highly persuasive and convincing when representing the viewpoints of classmates
- Is supportive and is okay with being in the background when needed
- Takes charge to help the president when their plates start filling up
- Develops strong relationships within the class to gauge opinions and concerns

Of course, you'd want these traits in any person in leadership, but I've often noticed good class vice presidents possessing these. Perhaps something to think about.

### Treasurer
Luckily, the position of class treasurer doesn't really need much explanation. So I'll cut to the chase -- here's what you'll want in one:

- Is responsible with money
- Is on top of deadlines, dues, and budgets
- Is efficient with collection and dispersion of funds
- Works will with taking direction from the president and vice president
- Takes initiative when it comes to money related responsibilities. 

Our class treasurer traditionally also helps to celebrate birthdays. This is probably one of the greatest morale boosters during dreadful weeks: a happy song and a small gift presented by the treasurer on your special day of birth. Whether it be collection for gifts or a project or something else, you'll rely on a competent treasurer on the regular. 

### Secretary
In my humble opinion, this position provides the most useful tangible benefits for the class. They are responsible for keeping records, itineraries, reminders, and schedules. **The class schedule is one of the most referenced resource for your cohort.** It's critical that the publishing of that schedule is nice, neat, timely, and accurate.

With this in mind, you'll want someone who

- Is highly detailed oriented and prompt
- Cares about how things look and will be perceived
- Is not afraid to reach out when they don't know something
- Is handy with a spreadsheet or schedule software
- Is aware of ongoing events and active in making sure it makes it on the schedule
- Easy to communicate with

*The schedule itself might be horrifying, but at least it's nice to look at.*

Lots of credit to the class secretary. Their job is all about details and announcements. Every Sunday during school my class gets an email from our secretary with all the events, tests, and other important information. It's the primer we need to get us ready for our week.

## Conclusion
The executive board dynamic and responsibilities will contribute towards making your optometry school experience. But regardless of how much it matters who your class officers are, being a good classmate and participant in the system matter just as much. Keep this things in mind:

- Be patient and understanding. The officers are fellow classmates and students, just like you.
- Sometimes the officers are just the messengers. If a vote doesn't got your way or a decision comes down you don't quite agree with, it's a good opportunity to have a real informed and civil discussion about how you feel.
- Class officers can be up for reelection from time to time. Choosing one person doesn't mean you have to stay with them for the rest of your years here. But it also doesn't mean you need to change them.
- When finals come around, the officers take charge and help you build your finals schedule that is submitted to the faculty. Be sure to make your voice heard, but also be understanding of other voices in the room as well!

Like many of the other small details and information that will get thrown at you first semester, you'll find the rhythm and inner workings soon. Hopefully this has given you a bit more of a perspective when it comes to electing and interacting with class officers -- and a bit of gratitude for what they do.
