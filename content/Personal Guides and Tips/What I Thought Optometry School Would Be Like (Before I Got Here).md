# 🧠 Introduction

Before I started optometry school, I had a very clear picture in my head of what it would be like.
Some of it turned out to be true.

Some of it… not so much.

Looking back, I realize that having expectations — even imperfect ones — helped me mentally prepare.
But it also made it easy to feel overwhelmed when reality didn’t exactly match the picture.

Here’s what I thought school would be like — and what I learned once I was actually living it.

## ✨ What I Expected

- **Structured days with predictable schedules**
I thought every day would be tightly organized: lecture → lab → study → sleep, repeat.
- **Immediate immersion into eye-specific knowledge**
I assumed we’d dive straight into lenses, prescriptions, and eye diseases from Day One.
- **Tight community feel**
I imagined bonding quickly with classmates, like a second family forming overnight.
- **Constant pressure, but manageable**
I knew it would be hard — but I thought it would be a “steady work hard” kind of hard, not a “firehose” experience.
- **Feeling like a future doctor every day**
I expected that I’d constantly feel professional, growing closer to being a clinician with every new week.

## 🎯 What Actually Happened

- **Schedules were structured… but fast and demanding**
Days were organized, but the sheer volume of material made it feel like there was never enough time.
- **General science before specialty knowledge**
We spent a lot of first semester mastering anatomy, microbiology, optics — foundations before touching clinical care in depth. However, we did get started pretty fast with Methods! But even though we took it slow and started with the bare basics.
- **Community took time to build**
The bonds absolutely formed, and formed quickly — but it wasn’t overnight. It grew through small shared struggles: late night studying, practicals, stress before exams.
- **The pressure felt like a wave, not a faucet**
Some weeks felt manageable, but others felt overwhelming — especially when exams stacked up or practicals loomed.
- **Growing into professionalism was gradual**
Some days I felt confident. Other days I doubted myself. That was normal. Feeling like a “future doctor” wasn’t an instant switch — it was a process.

## 🛠 Key Takeaways

- It’s okay if the real experience feels different than what you imagined — it doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong.
- Community, confidence, and clinical skills are built over time, not on the first day.
- First semester is about building your foundation — trust that the eye-specific knowledge and clinical confidence will come.
- Expect some weeks to be tough, some to be manageable — and know that neither defines your worth or your future.
