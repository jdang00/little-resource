## 🧠 Introduction

One of the biggest mindset shifts in optometry school isn’t about study habits — it’s about time.

I came in thinking I could treat weekends the same way I did in undergrad: rest, hang out, maybe study a little on Sunday night. I learned fast — that’s not always enough.

Many weekends quickly became working days. Saturday was a perfect opportunity to have a devoted study day, and after church on Sunday was perfect to brush up skills or cram for an exam. But not every weekend needs to be study time.

# 🔥 When You Should Give Up a Weekend

- **Before big practicals or stacked exams**
You need time for spaced repetition. Waiting until Monday means you’re already too late.
- **When you’re falling behind in heavy classes**
If you feel lost in Anatomy or Micro by Thursday, the weekend is a lifeboat to catch up before it sinks deeper.
- **When a big project or assignment is hanging over you**
“I’ll do it later” becomes “I can’t finish it well” very quickly.

## 🧘‍♂️ When You Shouldn’t (and Why Rest Matters)

- **If you’re caught up and burning out**
Grinding non-stop doesn’t help if your brain’s fried. Sometimes a full Saturday off means Sunday and Monday are twice as productive. But on weekends that I’m caught up, planning to go home or going out with friends really hits that reset button for the next week.
- **If it’s a low-stakes week**
Not every week is finals week. Not every assignment deserves a full weekend’s sacrifice.
- **If you feel resentment building**
If you catch yourself feeling bitter every weekend you work — it’s a sign you’re losing the long game. Worst case? Even with a test heavy week, taking that weekend off might be the course correction you need. You’re training for a marathon, not a sprint.

# 🛠️ What Worked for Me

- **Weekly Check-In:**
Every Friday, I looked at the next week’s calendar:
“Is there something I need breathing room for?”
If yes → weekend = work.
If no → minimum touch points (light review), but protected rest otherwise.
- **Protecting half-days when possible:**
I rarely worked both Saturday and Sunday full blast unless it was absolutely necessary.
A half-day of deep work + half-day of rest worked better long-term.
- **Celebrating “work weekends” after the fact:**
If I sacrificed a weekend, I tried to reward myself the next one — even if it was just a chill day off or a meal with friends. It made the grind sustainable.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Sacrificing weekends is part of the deal — but not every weekend has to be a sacrifice.
- Know when working is strategic — and when resting is survival.
- You don’t have to earn your place in optometry school by suffering every single weekend.
You earn it by lasting, learning, and growing steadily.
